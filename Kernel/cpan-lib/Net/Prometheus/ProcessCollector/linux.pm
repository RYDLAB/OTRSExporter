=head1 NAME

C<Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector::linux> - Process Collector for F<linux> OS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Net::Prometheus;
   use Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector::linux;

   my $prometheus = Net::Prometheus->new;

   $prometheus->register( Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector::linux->new );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a L<Net::Prometheus> collector instance to provide
process-wide metrics for a process running on the F<linux> operating system.

At collection time, if the requested process does not exist, no metrics are
returned.

=head2 Other Process Collection

The C<pid> argument allows the collector to collect from processes other than
the one actually running the code.

Note also that scraping processes owned by other users may not be possible for
non-root users. In particular, most systems do not let non-root users see the
L</proc/self/fd> directory of processes they don't own. In this case, the
C<process_open_fds> metric will not be returned.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

   $collector = Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector::linux->new( %args )

As well as the default arguments supported by
L<Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector>, the following extra named arguments are
recognised:

=over

=item pid => STR

The numerical PID to collect information about; defaults to the string
C<"self"> allowing the exporter to collect information about itself, even over
fork calls.

If the collector is collecting from C<"self"> or from a numerical PID that
matches its own PID, then it will subtract 1 from the count of open file
handles, to account for the C<readdir()> handle being used to collect that
count. If it is collecting a different process, it will not.
